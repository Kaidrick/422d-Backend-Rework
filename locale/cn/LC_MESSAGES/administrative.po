"Message Of The Day:\n"
"422d server will be testing the backend software on the server in the next "
"few months.\n"
"Due to the instability of the current DCS World build, the server are likely "
"to crash at some point, or merely stop to work at all.\n"
"If <F.10 Other> option failed to show up in the radio menu, or static "
"aircrafts on the apron do not de-spawn, it might be the backend software "
"lost connection with DCS World server.\n"
"Please understand that these issues might be common before Eagle Dynamics "
"implements the new Dedicated Server.\n"
"\n"
"And we wish you a Happy New Year 2019!\n"

"每日信息：\n"
"422d服务器将会在接下来的几个月中继续测试服务器后台程序。\n"
"由于现在DCS World程序的不稳定性，服务器很可能会在某个时刻崩溃，或者完全停止响"
"应用户的请求。\n"
"如果玩家飞机出生时，无线电菜单中的<F.10 其他>选项没有出现，或者停机坪上的静态"
"飞机没有根据玩家状态自动消失，这表明后台程序与DCS World本地服务器间的连接中"
"断。\n"
"因此，请务必理解，在Eagle Dynamics实装新的服务器程序前，这些错误和故障可能会"
"一直持续下去。\n"
"\n"
"另外，祝您2019年新年快乐！\n"

"Server Basic Rule:\n"
"1. Since this server is still in testing phase, the rule is not that "
"strict.\n"
"2. Avoid team kill as much as possible. You might be auto-banned by the "
"server backend.\n"

"服务器基本规则：\n"
"1. 由于服务器和后台程序仍处于早期测试阶段，服务器规则并不严格。\n"
"2. 避免有意或无意击杀其他玩家。你可能会被服务器后台自动封禁。\n"

"Q: What this is server for? Is it PvE or PvP or what?\n"
"A: This is a server hosted by Virtual 422d Test and Evaluation Squadron. Our "
"aim is to provide a multi-player based test environment for weapons and "
"aircrafts in DCS World.\n"
"We use a backend software to retrieve data from and interact with DCS World "
"server. This server is also intended to provide a training environment for "
"422d TES. During training sessions the server will be passworld protected.\n"
"\n"
"Q: What kind of features does this server offer?\n"
"A: One of the most important feature is the server backend's capability to "
"integrate and interpret different kinds of information from different "
"sources.\n"
"In general, DCS World data are obtained through Export, Control API or "
"Mission. A lua server is built in each of these three environment. "
"Therefore, the server can easily query DCS for a more detailed picture of a "
"specific unit or player.\n"
"For instance, through the net table in Control API, the server will be able "
"to see what language version is a new connected user is using; however, this "
"kind of information is not accessible from Mission environment.\n"
"When the backend has access to all three environment, it is rather easy to "
"customize the message locale and system of measurement for different client "
"language.\n"
"\n"
"Q: I have interest in joining 422d TES?\n"
"A: This squadron is invited only for the time being. \n"

"\n"
"Q：这个服务器是做什么的？是PvE还是PvP还是别的什么？\n"
"A：这是个由虚拟422d测试和评估中队主办的服务器。我们的目标是为DCS World中所有"
"飞机及相关武器提供一个多人游戏环境下的测试和评估环境。\n"
"我们使用一个后台程序来抽取数据并和DCS World本地服务器交互。这个服务器也将被用"
"于为422d TES内部提供训练和考核。在训练或考核期间，服务器设有密码保护。\n"
"\n"
"Q：这个服务器有哪些特点？\n"
"A：其中一个最主要的特点便是后台程序整合并分析不同信息来源数据的能力。\n"
"通常来说，DCS World中的数据可以通过Export、控制API或任务环境来获得。对于这个"
"服务器而言，每个不同环境中都植入了一个lua服务器代码。因此，服务器可以轻而易举"
"地从DCS中获得更完整和详细的用户/单位信息。\n"
"比如，通过控制API中的net表，服务器可以看到连接到服务器的新用户使用了何种语言"
"的客户端。然而，这样的信息对于任务环境来说是不可见的。\n"
"一旦后台程序可以同时获取数据并通过响应的环境来控制DCS World的行为，通过用户语"
"言和用户偏好的计量单位（公制/英制）来为玩家量身定制通知和游戏内触发消息就变得"
"轻而易举。\n"
"\n"
"Q：我有兴趣加入422d TES？\n"
"A：暂时只通过邀请的方式接受新成员。\n"
