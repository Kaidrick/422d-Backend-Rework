"Message Of The Day:\n"
"422d server will be testing the backend software on the server in the next "
"few months.\n"
"Due to the instability of the current DCS World build, the server are likely "
"to crash at some point, or merely stop to work at all.\n"
"If <F.10 Other> option failed to show up in the radio menu, or static "
"aircrafts on the apron do not de-spawn, it might be the backend software "
"lost connection with DCS World server.\n"
"Please understand that these issues might be common before Eagle Dynamics "
"implements the new Dedicated Server.\n"
"\n"
"And we wish you a Happy New Year 2019!\n"

"Server Basic Rule:\n"
"1. Since this server is still in testing phase, the rule is not that "
"strict.\n"
"2. Avoid team kill as much as possible. You might be auto-banned by the "
"server backend.\n"

"Q: What this is server for? Is it PvE or PvP or what?\n"
"A: This is a server hosted by Virtual 422d Test and Evaluation Squadron. Our "
"aim is to provide a multi-player based test environment for weapons and "
"aircrafts in DCS World.\n"
"We use a backend software to retrieve data from and interact with DCS World "
"server. This server is also intended to provide a training environment for "
"422d TES. During training sessions the server will be passworld protected.\n"
"\n"
"Q: What kind of features does this server offer?\n"
"A: One of the most important feature is the server backend's capability to "
"integrate and interpret different kinds of information from different "
"sources.\n"
"In general, DCS World data are obtained through Export, Control API or "
"Mission. A lua server is built in each of these three environment. "
"Therefore, the server can easily query DCS for a more detailed picture of a "
"specific unit or player.\n"
"For instance, through the net table in Control API, the server will be able "
"to see what language version is a new connected user is using; however, this "
"kind of information is not accessible from Mission environment.\n"
"When the backend has access to all three environment, it is rather easy to "
"customize the message locale and system of measurement for different client "
"language.\n"
"\n"
"Q: I have interest in joining 422d TES?\n"
"A: This squadron is invited only for the time being. \n"
