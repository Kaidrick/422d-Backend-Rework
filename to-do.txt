1. need more spark, for example, aircraft takeoff, landing, startup, shutdown
    * takeoff and landing --> this is probably better handled by game event
    * startup/shutdown --> doesn't seem to work in multi-player
        so the only clue is the fuel amount
        - when a player aircraft spawn, set a started flag, if fuel amount starts to decrease in a certain range,
          assert engine start. and if fuel consumption is zero, assert engine shutdown

2. session tracker, which record data based on event or spark
    * takeoff time
    * land time
    * flight time

3. finish <aircraft_type_system_of_measurement.py>
