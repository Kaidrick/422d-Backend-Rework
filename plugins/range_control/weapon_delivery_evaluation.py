"""
Some design note here:
Every single weapon release in NTTR should be recorded
Player release weapon --> weapon release signal --> weapon object generated
--> weapon data updated --> weapon terminal --> process weapon data --> sort batch based on release time
--> report to user after leaving live area and entering transitional area
